<h1>AsynDribble Support</h1>

<p>This module provides an Asyn Interpose layer for asynOctet that
  inserts a delay between each transmitted character.</p>

<p>Follow the instructions under <a href="#Installation">Installation
  and Building</a> below once to build the module at your site, then
  the <a href="#Using">Using</a> instructions to add it to each IOC
  application.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Release Notes</h2>

<h3>Version 1.2 &mdash; ANJ &mdash; 2011-03-07</h3>

<p>Modified the configuration routine to expect the delay interval as
  an integer in milli-seconds, which is compatible with use from the
  vxWorks target shell. Added documentation for the configuration
  command, these release notes, and the LICENSE file.</p>

<h3>Version 1.1 &mdash; WEN &mdash; 2009-09-17</h3>

<p>Initial release.</p>

<h2><a name="Using">Using AsynDribble support in an application</a></h2>

<p>Several files need minor modifications to use AsynDribble
  support in an IOC application.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add the full path to the asynDribble support directory to the
    application's <tt>configure/RELEASE</tt> file:<br />
    <tt>ASYNDRIBBLE=/<i>path/to</i>/asynDribble-1.2</tt></li>

  <li>Add support to application database definition file<br /> The
    application database definition file must include the database
    definition files for asynDribble and any needed ASYN drivers.
    There are two ways that this can be done:
    <ul>
      <li>If you are building your application database definition file from
        an <tt><i>xxx</i>Include.dbd</tt> file you include the additional
        database definitions in that file:<br />
        <tt>include "base.dbd"</tt><br />
        <tt>include "asynInterposeDribble.dbd"</tt><br />
      </li>
      <li>If you are building your application database definition file from
        the application Makefile you specify the aditional database
        definitions there:<br />
        <tt><i>xxx</i>_DBD += base.dbd</tt><br />
        <tt><i>xxx</i>_DBD += asynInterposeDribble.dbd</tt><br />
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Add the asynDribble support library to the application, before
    the Asyn and Base libraries. Add the line shown in bold below to
    the application's <tt>src/Makefile</tt> (the other lines or their
    equivalent should already be present if you are already using
    Asyn):<br />
    <b><tt><i>xxx</i>_LIBS += asynInterposeDribble</tt></b><br />
    <tt><i>xxx</i>_LIBS += asyn</tt><br />
    <tt><i>xxx</i>_LIBS += $(EPICS_BASE_IOC_LIBS)</tt></li>

  <li>To use the Asyn Interpose layer on a particular Asyn port, add
    the following command to the IOC's startup script:<br />
    <tt>asynInterposeDribbleConfig "<i>port name</i>", <i>addr</i>,
      <i>interval</i></tt><br />
    where the port name and address specify the Asyn port to dribble and
      interval is the inter-character time delay in milliseconds. The
      interval defaults to 100ms if negative, zero or not provided.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2><a name="Installation">Installation and Building</a></h2>

<p>After obtaining a copy of the distribution, it must be installed and built
  for use at your site.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Copy the distribution file into a suitable installation directory.</li>
  <li>Execute the following commands:<br />
    <tt>tar xfz asynDribble-1.2.tar.gz</tt><br />
    <tt>cd asynDribble-1.2</tt></li>
  <li>Edit the <tt>configure/RELEASE</tt> file and set the paths to your
    installation of EPICS Base and ASYN.</li>
  <li>Execute <tt>make</tt> in the top level directory.</li>
</ol>
