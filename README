Support for GeniCam compliant cameras w/ GenCP as the serial protocol.

A command line tool is built: bin/$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH)/GenCpTool

GenCpTool Usage: 
    -h              - Help message
    --help          - Help message
    -c N            - channel #
    --channel N     - channel #
    -u N            - Unit number (default 0)
    --unit N        - Unit number (default 0)
    --readXml fname - Read XML GeniCam file and write to fname
    --U16 Addr      - Read 16 bit unsigned value from address
    --U32 Addr      - Read 32 bit unsigned value from address
    --U64 Addr      - Read 64 bit unsigned value from address
    --C20 Addr      - Read 20 character string from address
    --C82 Addr      - Read 82 character string from address, etc for other counts

For some cameras, the XML file is in zip format, in which case the
file is written to fname.zip.
Extract the file using unzip, and if desired, reformat using xmllint.

Example:
bin/linux-x86_64/GenCpTool -c 1 -u 0 --readXml goldEye.xml
unzip goldEye.xml.zip 
xmllint --format genicam-stdccd.xml  > avtGoldEye008.xml
